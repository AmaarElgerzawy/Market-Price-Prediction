# Introdution 
AI models have revolutionized the world of trading, offering powerful tools to analyze financial 
markets and make data-driven decisions. Machine learning models, such as neural networks 
and reinforcement learning algorithms, have gained prominence in trading strategies. Neural 
networks, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks 
(RNNs), excel at analyzing time-series data and capturing intricate patterns. They can forecast 
future price movements, optimize portfolios, and manage risks. Reinforcement learning models 
enable the development of autonomous trading agents that learn optimal strategies through 
interaction with market environments. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are used to 
extract insights from textual data, such as news articles and social media, helping traders gauge 
market sentiment and identify news-driven opportunities. Ensemble models combine the 
predictions of multiple models, enhancing accuracy and robustness.
